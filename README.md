A C++ implementation of logic gates and simple gate-level circuits.

The objective of this project is to emulate logic gates and simple gate-level circuits.  
The code is not meant to be fast or efficient in implementing components or computations,  
but is intended to be analogous to their actual physical design.  
  
The logic gates considered as basic are the AND, OR, and NOT gates.  
All other circuit elements have been builtt using them.  
  
Objectives:
- [x] Basic logic gates
- [x] Other gates using basic ones
- [x] CMake
- [x] LogicGate base class
- [x] Truth Table Helper
- [x] Doxygen-Style Documentation
- [ ] Build instructions
- [ ] Latches & Clock System
- [ ] Flip-Flops
