A C++ implementation of logic gates and simple gate-level circuits.

The objective of this project is to emulate logic gates and simple gate-level circuits.  
The code is not meant to be fast or efficient in implementing components or computations,  
but is intended to be analogous to their actual physical design.  
  
The logic gates considered as basic are the AND, OR, and NOT gates.  
  
TODO:
- [x] Implement basic logic gates
- [x] Implement other gates using basic ones
- [x] CMake
- [ ] Build instructions
